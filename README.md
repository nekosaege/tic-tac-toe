# tic-tac-toe
My project is a famous game called Tic-Tac-Toe.

Tic-Tac-Toe is a simple yet strategic thinking game usually played on a 3x3 grid. Two players compete, one using the symbol "X" and the other "O". The objective of the game is to line up three identical symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally before the opponent.

1) Choose a symbol: Player 1 is X, Player 2 is O.
2) Take turns: Click on an empty square to place your symbol.
3) Win the game: The first player to get three of their symbols in a row — horizontally, vertically, or diagonally — wins!
4) Draw: If all squares are filled and no one has won, it's a draw.
